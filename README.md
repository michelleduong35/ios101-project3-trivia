## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
SOOOO MANY CHALLENGES. As this was my first time building an iOS app from scratch (without the skeleton) I had a hard time connecting my code to my UI. I spent a decent amount of time having to redo the UI as the constraints made my app look wonky at times. When I finally got to writing my code, my buttons wouldn't work (Solution: remember to connect the FUNCTION to the buttons!).
